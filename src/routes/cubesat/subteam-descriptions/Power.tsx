        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-1">
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">Power Generation:</span> Designing and

            size constraints and orbital conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">Energy Storage:</span> Selecting and

            Developing circuitry and power buses that step voltages up or down,
            protect against faults, and allocate power efficiently to
            subsystems.

          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">Monitoring & Fault Protection:</span>{" "}
            Implementing sensors, current limiting, and fault detection systems
            to safeguard against overcurrent, overvoltage, or battery
            degradation.

          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">Testing & Validation:</span> Conducting
            power budget analysis, hardware-in-the-loop testing, and lifetime

          In essence, the Power Team provides the electrical lifeblood of the
          CubeSat, making certain that every component has the energy required
          to perform its function across the missionâ€™s lifetime.
